In the project I completed using React and TypeScript, I created a random quote machine. The site fetches quotes from a JSON file and displays them randomly to the user. Users can interact with the site to generate new quotes and potentially find inspiration or motivation from the diverse collection of quotes available. The project likely involved creating components to manage the quote fetching and displaying logic, as well as implementing a design that is both visually appealing and user-friendly.
